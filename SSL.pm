=head1 NAME

Socket::Class::SSL - SSL support for Socket::Class


=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Socket::Class::SSL;
  
  $s = Socket::Class::SSL->new( ... );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The module inherits L<Socket::Class> and adds SSL support implemented
by the OpenSSL Toolkit.
Only the differences to Socket::Class are documented here.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=head2 Simple HTTPS Server

  use Socket::Class::SSL;
  
  $s = Socket::Class::SSL->new(
      'local_port' => 10443,
      'listen' => 10,
      #'private_key' => 'cert/server.key',
      #'certificate' => 'cert/server.crt',
  ) or die Socket::Class->error;
  
  while( $c = $s->accept ) {
      # read request header
      while( $l = $c->readline ) {
          print $l, "\n";
      }
      # send response header
      $c->write(
          "HTTP/1.0 200 OK\r\n" .
          "Server: SSL Server\r\n" .
          "\r\n"
      );
      # send response content
      $c->write( "content" );
  }

=head2 Simple HTTPS Client

  use Socket::Class::SSL;
  
  $c = Socket::Class::SSL->new(
      'remote_port' => 10443,
  ) or die Socket::Class->error;
  
  # send request
  $c->write(
      "GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n" .
      "Host: localhost\r\n" .
      "\r\n"
  );
  
  # read response header
  while( $l = $c->readline ) {
      print $l, "\n";
  }
  
  # read response content
  $c->read( $buf, 1048576 );
  print $buf;

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item B<new ( [%arg] )>

Additional arguments to Socket::Class.

=for formatter none

  private_key    Path to private key file in PEM format
  certificate    Path to certificate file in PEM format
  client_ca      Path to PEM formatted file with CA certificates
                 to send to the client
  ca_file        A file of CA certificates in PEM format
  ca_path        A directory containing CA certificates in PEM format

=for formatter perl

=item B<set_certificate ( $certificate )>

Adds a certificate chain. The certificates must be in PEM format and must
be sorted starting with the subject`s certificate (actual client or server
certificate), followed by intermediate CA certificates if applicable, and
ending at the highest level (root) CA.

B<Parameters>

=over

=item I<$certificate>

Path to certificate file in PEM format.

=back

B<Return Values>

Returns a true value on sucess or undef on failure.

=item B<set_private_key ( $private_key )>

Adds a private key to the socket. To change a certificate, private key pair
the new certificate needs to be set before setting the private key.

B<Parameters>

=over

=item I<$private_key>

Path to private key file in PEM format.

=back

B<Return Values>

Returns a true value on sucess or undef on failure.

=item B<check_private_key ()>

Verifies that the private key agrees with the corresponding public key
in the certificate.

Returns a true value on success or undef on failure.

The following are the most likely causes of errors: 

=over

=item * The private key file does not match the corresponding public key
in the certificate. 

=item * A certificate file was not loaded. 

=item * A key file was not loaded. 

=back

=item B<set_client_ca ( $client_ca )>

Reads a file of PEM formatted certificates and sets the list of CA names
sent to the client when requesting a client certificate

B<Parameters>

=over

=item I<$client_ca>

Path to PEM formatted file with CA certificates to send to the client.

=back

B<Return Values>

Returns a true value on sucess or undef on failure.

B<Note>

The CAs listed do not become trusted (list only contains the names, not
the complete certificates); use I<set_verify_locations()> to additionally
load them for verification.

These function is only useful for TLS/SSL servers.

=item B<set_verify_locations ( $ca_file, $ca_path )>

Specifies the locations at which CA certificates for verification purposes
are located.

When building its own certificate chain, an OpenSSL client/server will
try to fill in missing certificates from I<$ca_file>/I<$ca_path>, if the
certificate chain was not explicitly specified.

B<Parameters>

=over

=item I<$ca_file>

If I<$ca_file> is defined, it points to a file of CA certificates in
PEM format. The file can contain several CA certificates identified by 

=for formatter none

 -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
 ... (CA certificate in base64 encoding) ...
 -----END CERTIFICATE-----

=for formatter perl

sequences. Before, between, and after the certificates text is allowed
which can be used e.g. for descriptions of the certificates. 

=item I<$ca_path>

If I<$ca_path> is defined, it points to a directory containing CA
certificates in PEM format. The files each contain one CA certificate.
The files are looked up by the CA subject name hash value, which must
hence be available. If more than one CA certificate with the same name
hash value exist, the extension must be different
(e.g. 9d66eef0.0, 9d66eef0.1 etc). The search is performed in the ordering
of the extension number, regardless of other properties of the certificates.

=back

When looking up CA certificates, the OpenSSL library will first search the
certificates in I<$ca_file>, then those in $I<ca_path>. Certificate matching
is done based on the subject name, the key identifier (if present), and the
serial number as taken from the certificate to be verified. If these data
do not match, the next certificate will be tried. If a first certificate
matching the parameters is found, the verification process will be performed;
no other certificates for the same parameters will be searched in case
of failure.

B<Return Values>

Returns a true value on success or undef on failure.

B<Note>

In server mode, when requesting a client certificate, the server must
send the list of CAs of which it will accept client certificates. This
list is not influenced by the contents of I<$ca_file> or I<$ca_path>
and must explicitly be set using the I<set_client_ca()> function. 

=item B<create_client_context ()>

Creates a SSL context explicitly for client sockets and supports
Secure Sockets Layer version 2 (SSLv2), Secure Sockets Layer version 3
(SSLv3), and Transport Layer Security version 1 (TLSv1).

The L<connect()|Socket::Class/connect> function implicitly creates the
client context.

=item B<create_server_context ()>

Creates a SSL context explicitly for server sockets and supports
Secure Sockets Layer version 2 (SSLv2), Secure Sockets Layer version 3
(SSLv3), and Transport Layer Security version 1 (TLSv1).

The L<listen()|Socket::Class/listen> function implicitly creates the
server context.

=item B<enable_compatibility ()>

Enables all bug workarounds available in the OpenSSL library.

See L<http://www.openssl.org/docs/ssl/SSL_CTX_set_options.html> for a list.

=item B<get_cipher_name ()>

Returns the name of the cipher in the current connection, or undef if no
connection exists.

=item B<get_cipher_version ()>

Returns the version of the cipher in the current connection, or undef if no
connection exists.

=back

=head1 XS / C API

The module provides a C interface for extension writers.
